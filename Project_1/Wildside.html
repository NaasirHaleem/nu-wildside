    <h1> Northwestern Football </h1>
    <p> After a rocky beginning, the Northwestern Football team went 8-1 in the Big Ten and won the West division.
      They would lose a thrilling game against Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship. However, they rebounded in a major way by upsetting
      Utah in the Holiday Bowl to win 31-24. They finished 9-5 on the season.

  <h1>Women's Softball</h1>
  <p> The Northwestern Women's Softball team had a tremendous regular season as they put together a record of 43-10.
    Unfortunately, they lost in the semi-finals of the Big Ten Tournament against a dominant Minnesota squad. They
    will be hosting the Evanston regional for the NCAA tournament.

  <h1>Women's Lacrosse</h1>
  <p>The Lacrosse team spent the regular season thrashing the competition as they finished the season to the tune of a 15-4 record.
    That was all put to the test with a monumental showdown against Maryland in the finals of the Big Ten Championship. True to form,
    the team upset the 'Terps to secure the Big Ten Title. In the first round of the NCAA tournament they downed Notre Dame 13-10. In the second round,
    the 'Cats claimed revenge on the Syracuse Orange who they had lost to earlier in the season by beating them 18-14.
